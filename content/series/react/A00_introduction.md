My journey with React began in 2014 when I was toying with integrating it with Meteor. It's now 2021, 7 years on, and React has changed a great deal. With so many changes, it's become harder and harder for people to learn and use React. This is because online tutorials and courses are writing React code using different styles - some uses Class Components whilst others use React Hooks, some uses Redux whilst others use React's Context. For newcomers, navigating this means they'll now have to read up on both Class Components and React Hooks, and then decipher for themselves which one they should use. They'll have to filter out the outdated articles with the relevant ones.
