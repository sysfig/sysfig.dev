Anything outside the curriculum is labelled 'extra-curricular activities'. But it shouldn't be like that. Here, 'curriculum' means a set of things that everyone must learn and will be assessed on; and 'extra-curricular activities' means they're optional and don't contribute to your grades.

Challenges

## Grading

**Problem: But if there's no curriculum, there's no standard for grading the students fairly across the board.**

But perhaps it's good that we stop caring so much about grades _in school_. I mean, outside of academia, no one assigns you grades for how you live your life. No one is going to give you a D because you've gamed too much in the past month. No one is giving you an A for getting promoted.

Institutions gives grades to students because they need to be assessed. High school assessment is needed so that the best students are fairly given priority to the best universities.

But assessment is the job of the exam boards, not the school. The focus of a school should not be 'to pass exams', but rather to provide an education. Yes, school needs to prepare students for exams to demonstrate their skills, but it should not be its main focus, and students should not see the top grades as their main goal.

Schools need to prepare students for the adult world. Yes, students need to grasp the basics - they need to work, make money, sustain themselves. But life is much more than sustenance. Life is about living, not surviving. School is about learning, not passing exams.

What matters is where you end up relative to where you began, not relative to everyone else.
