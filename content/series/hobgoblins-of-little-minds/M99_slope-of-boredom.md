If you're a team lead or engineering manager, don't always assign tasks to the most experienced/qualified person.

A lot of managers believe that the more proficient someone is at performing a task, the more productive they are. This is true... up to a certain point.

The first time I set up an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) workflow for a company - configuring backends, writing Terraform code, integrating automation tools - it was exciting; everything was new and I was motivated to learn. But I was not very efficient - constant reference to documentation, Google searches, and asking questions.

But the more times I've had to do it, the more efficient I become. However, there reached a point when it stopped being exciting and starts being boring.

Boredom is the symptom of an engineer not being challenged enough. Repeating the same process time after time doesn't teach you anything new. This leads to a lack of motivation, which leads to reduced effort and a decrease in efficiency. In the worse case scenarios, engineers who are not learning or progressing will leave.

Automation can be the solution, but there are processes which are impractical to automate. For these hard-to-automate tasks, putting the most experienced/qualified person on the task may not always yield the most efficient results. The role of the manager, then, is to find the right balance between learning and performing for each team member. Sometimes, it may be better to give tasks to less experienced team members, who has not yet reached the peak of their proficiency and is still motivated to learn, rather than someone who has started their journey down the slope of boredom.
