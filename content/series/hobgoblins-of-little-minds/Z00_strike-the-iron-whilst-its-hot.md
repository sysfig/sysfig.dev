I used to think that if you have an idea, that you should let it sit for a few months, and if after a few months you still think it's great, then go with it. The rationale behind that is you have a limited time, so whenever you commit to doing something, it better be good.

That's not bad advice.

But there are some great ideas that I've let sit for too long. Years. Yamichi is an idea I've had for 9 years. Goji is an idea I've had for at least 4. When I was letting the idea brew in my head, the first few months and years was useful as I try to elucidate and polish my idea, get feedback from trusted friends and colleagues.

But I've found that the longer I let the idea sit, the less passionate I become about the idea. The paradox here is the longer you let the idea brew, the more confident you can be (since it's stood the test of time), but the less likely you are motivated to execute it.

So, as with everything, the trick is to find a balance. Let it sit for a few weeks, get feedback from friends and research more on the topic during that time, and then execute it. Don't wait any longer. As you execute, your motivation will die down, it'll keep going down until you've got that all-important first user. After that boost, your motivation may still go down until the first paying user, until you break even, until you make enough money to do it full-time, until you have enough money to make it a viable business. All throughout that journey, you're going to lose motivation, so make sure you have a lot of motivation to start with.

Grit, determination is important, but motivation is as well. The journey will undoubtly be hard, so whenever you can, make it a little less hard on yourself. Motivation is like fuel for your car, without it, you can still use grit and determination to push the car to the final destination, but using gas is easier even if it doesn't get you the whole way.
