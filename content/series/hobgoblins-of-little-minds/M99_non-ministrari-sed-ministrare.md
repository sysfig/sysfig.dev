Prepreq: M99_multiplier

> _Non ministrari, sed ministrare_ in Latin means "Not to be served, but to serve".

In M99_multiplier, we touched on how a manager should have less direct, but more impactful influence on a company. Coding is direct, but less impactful work. Thus, a manager should not be coding.

Individual contributors' job is to code, and since a manager does not code, the manager should not view their subordinates as a group of minions that do their work for them. Because the job of a manager is to manage, not code, and individual contributors are good at coding, not managing.

The goal of the manager, then, is to impact the business by enabling their subordinates to be X% more efficient. A manager should identify the obstacles that's stopping the subordinate from producing good work efficiently, and remove that obstacle for them.

If the IC is unclear about how to implement a feature because the specification is ambiguous, coordinate a meeting between the IC and the product manager to iron out any ambiguity.

Even the task of assigning tasks to ICs should be viewed not as a task that's done from a position of authority, but rather as a position of facilitation. Without you, the manager, the ICs would have to look at the backlog and decide which tasks to do, which takes time away and forces them to mental switch from doing what they're good at - coding.

Your subsordinates do the most direct work and your job is to facilitate the administrative and managerial side so they can focus on doing their work. Yes, you manage them, but it is them who is doing the work that brings value to the business. Your job is to be a multiplier and make them more effective.
