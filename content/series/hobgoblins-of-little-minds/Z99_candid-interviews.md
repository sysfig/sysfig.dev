I love interviewing candidates because it gives me control about the people I would be working with. I would be able to screen out egotistical and shoddy developers. I like to ask candidates to explain a concept they've put on their CV to see if they really understand it (and not just fluffing their CV with keywords).

Being on the other side of the table many times, I understand how the interview process can make someone nervous and not perform as well as they would have. And so I try to encourage them by telling them what I think they are doing well. I'll also make notes on what they did well and not so well to discuss with my colleagues and/or co-interviewers later, to make a decision as to whether to carry on with the process.

What I've described so far is nothing out of the ordinary.

But it can lead to situations where, because the interviewers only gave the candidate positive feedback throughout the interview, it would make them think that they did really well, and would be surprised when an offer is not extended to them after. It's like getting glowing performance reviews for the last few years and suddenly get fired for underperforming.

When someone is being fired for underperforming, they should not be finding out their shortcomings during a performance review, the manager should have given the feedback multiple times before it comes to the review. Similarly, to avoid surprising the candidate, I would always try to give candid feedback _during_ an interview instead of after.

If I asked them to explain a concept, and they were being vague with the answer, I would:

- repeat what they've told me (to show them I've listened and understood their answer)
- explain why the answer is not up to scratch
- re-iterate the kind of answers I am looking for

I give the candidate immediate feedback so they can do better for the question being asked, as well as for subsequent questions.

The feedback I give needs to be constructive and focuses on the positives, not negatives.
  - Bad - "The answer was a bit vague"
  - Good - "You mentioned some key words there, such as 'controllers' and 'providers', but I am looking for a more detailed description of how these concepts fit together. Can you, for example, explain how controllers, providers, and modules work with each other?"

You feedback should guide the candidate to improve on their existing answer.
