Most people think software is about building applications/programs/websites that work. It's not. That's 'just' programming.

You can create a fully-functional program that is performant but hard to make changes. You can say you've 'programmed', but you can't say you've 'software engineered'.

The _soft_ in software means you can changes easily by changing bits in memory, as opposed to hardware, where you have to physically manufacture and assemble components together.

This is what is great about software. You can ship an MVP and iteratively improve on it by making tiny changes until it is a well-rounded product. In other words, the great thing about software is its embrace of change.

So when I see applications where their components are highly-coupled (i.e. spaghetti code), where there's little documentation, where there's little thought going into object/database schemas, the people who created those applications should not be called software engineers, they should be called coders/programmers.

Programmers care that the code works now. Software engineers care that the code can evolve and still works a decade from now.

Most employers use the terms interchangeably, so make sure, in your technical interview, to figure out whether your organization is full of programmers or full of software engineers. The last thing you want is to be stuck in team of programmers. One sign you can look for during interviews is that if the interviews for a mid- to senior-roles focuses a lot on coding skills and tools, and not go into enough depth into software engineering, then it's probably not a company where you can learn and grow.

Generally, agencies tend to be full of programmers and not software engineers. This is because they have a contract with a set of measureable feature requirements that they must meet.

> Note that many entry- and junior-level software engineers may actually be programmers, in the sense that they focus more on being technically-proficient, relying on and learning from mid- to senior-level colleagues about patterns and best practices.
> So for me, the distinction is more about attitude rather than ability.

Most coding bootcamps are just that - it teaches you how to code (i.e. program), but it doesn't teach you how to 'software engineer'.

The value of a new technical hire is not in how well they can code (low-value), but how well they can software engineer.
