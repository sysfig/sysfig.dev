# Proactively Ask For Feedback

Everyone - your manager, your peers, your subordinates - have an opinion about you. Some opinions may be positive, some negative. Depending on your company, many are happy to publicly annouce their positive feedback, but the vast majority of them are likely to keep the negative opinions to themselves, and only a tiny select few are comfortable giving you negative feedback in private. Afterall, in a risk-reward sense, the person providing you with negative feedback may not benefit from it, but risks souring their relationship with you if you don't think the feedback is fair.

Yes, positive feedback is important - it's great to know what you are doing well so you can keep doing it - but they are relatively easier to come by. The negative feedback are more scarce and thus often more valuable.

probably a lot of things they don't like, but they don't want to tell you because (a) it may be a minor issue and has not passed the threshold of speaking out (b) they may be scared you won't take their feedback well


Here are a few tips to get good feedback:

- Start with questions about something specific and recent - it's much easier to give feedback on something specific and fresh in their memory than something that happened a long time ago. It is also feedback that is most likely to get lost or forgotten; so capture those fast.
- When other people ask you for feedback, make sure to give good feedback. The feedback you give sets the level of feedback you expect to receive. If your friend gifts you a gaming keyboard for your birthday, they'll probably expect more than a $10 gift card from you for their birthday.
- Take immediate action on the feedback you've been given - when people see that you take their feedback seriously, they are more likely to give feedback in the future. If you disagree with the feedback, try to take some action to at least show that you've considered their feedback.

When should you ask for feedback?

- After you've done something new - in a few of the customer-facing companies I've worked at, every employee must take on the role of a customer support/success representative, so that they understand and develop empathy for their end-users. I think it's a great initiative because each time I am faced with a customer query I don't know the answer to, it's a learning opportunity to know the company better. But am I using the correct tone of voice? Am I responding quick enough? Should I ask for help more or try to spend more time to try to find the answer on my own? Since I am new to the role, I am not calibrated with the expectations of the customer success team, and the only way I can do that is through feedback. When you are new to something, people don't expect you to do well, and so are more likely to give you constructive feedback. So after starting a new role or carrying out a new task is aarguably the best time to proactively ask for feedback.
- Immediately after an event - a meeting, a presentation, 
- Periodically - I aim to ask everyone for feedback every month

- running your own peer reviews
- organizing project retrospectives

As you progress in your career, there are fewer and fewer mentors at a level higher than you, that you can look up to and learn from (you can always learn from anyone from any levels, but you it is most effective learning from people who are at a career position of where you want to be, you want to learn how they got there).

So feedback is more and more important the more senior you become.
