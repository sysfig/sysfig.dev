Early on in my career, I loved job hunting. Back when I was an entry-level or junior developer, finding a job was easy, as long as I showed I can code and am a team player, most company would extend me an offer. It was a great feeling when you get back 5, 6 offers and have to pick between them. Preparing for interviews was easy, and involves reading up documentation on the languages and/or frameworks you listed on your CV, taking coding challenges, and Googling "Software engineer interview questions and answers".

Nowadays, I absolutely loathe interviews. Now, to prepare for an interview, I have to write a 10, 20 page document detailing my achievements, and how I contributed to a project, how I dealt with a problem, how I handle disagreements, outline a time I showed leadership without formal authority, etc.

As someone who hates blowing one's trumpet, I don't regularly sit down to record how well I handled every situation. I have tried to make a habit of doing this every now and then, to make sure the prepartion for the next set of interviews easier, but it ends up being like an acting audition. You have to practice interviewing before you get good. So the first few interviews are usually quite bad, and I try to get some practice with companies I am not falling head over heels for in my first few interviews (if they turn out well, I would of course take the offer, but I don't set myself or the company too high an expectation)

Keep a running record of how you handled a tough situation. Keep a running record of your achievements.
