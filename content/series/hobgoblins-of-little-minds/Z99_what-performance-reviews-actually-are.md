# What Performance Reviews Actually Are

Most workplaces perform a performance review every 6 months or a year. Theoretically, a performance review provides an formal setting to:

- assess the employee's performance against a set of metrics
- provide employees with feedback
- offer employees a promotion, bonus, and/or increase in salary
- for employees to give feedback to management

But all these actions can better carried out as soon as it is appropriate. You certainly shouldn't keep a record of someone's feedback and unload it on them every 6 months, nor should you delay someone's promotion a few months after they've reached a big milestone.

So formal performance reviews are actually a thinly-disguised bureaucratic procedure to 'cover the company's ass' should they need to fire an underperforming employee.

## What is a performance review?

A performance review may involve any or all of the following:

- self-assessment - you list:
  - your achievements
  - shortcomings
  - how you want to grow in the future (what roles you want to transition in to, what training you want to partake)
- peer reviews
  - achievements
  - areas of improvement

The manager of the employee would review the self-assessment and peer reviews, and, in addition to the manager's own assessment, provide the employee with a performance rating.

If an employee is underperforming, they may get placed into a _Performance Improvement Plan_ (PIP). A PIP is a formal document that outlines an employee's performance issues, and setting concrete/hard goals that needs to be reached within a certain deadline (usually 30, 60, and 90 days). If the employee is unable to meet those goals, then it's a basis/evidence for HR to justify firing the employee.

A PIP is required to prevent companies from being sued for wrongful termination.
