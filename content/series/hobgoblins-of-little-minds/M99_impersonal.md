Instead of saying "You are confusing the Single Responsibility Principle and the Separation of Concerns", you can say "There are some differences in our understanding of the Single Responsibility Principle and the Separation of Concerns"

With the first, you are accusing someone of making a mistake, the conversation would now become more combative, right vs. wrong. Whereas the second approach is more explorative (there's a difference between our views - I'm not saying you're wrong or I am wrong, let's just figure out the differences and maybe we will both learn something).
