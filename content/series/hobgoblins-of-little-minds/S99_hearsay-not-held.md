A common expression?? that I often hear from interviewees when asked about how they deal with situations when they disagree with others is that they have "strong opinions, weakly held".

This expression is supposed to put them in a positive light, mostly because of the "weakly held" part. That they have a way of doing things, but if contrary evidence are presented, they are happy to let go of their opinion. But if they are so ready to let go of their opinion, why were they even holding on to it (however weakly) in the first place?

A strong opinion is one that is polarized? Extreme? But why have a strong opinion in the first place? Most debates are not black-and-white, there are always nuances. Is it always bad to not write tests for your code? A strong opinion would be "Of course it's always bad! How else would you know it even works?" But what about for an MVP? What about during a hackathon? What if the logic is simple? In these cases, it may not be the best option to write tests.

A strong opinion is often an unfounded opinion, backed with, at best, experience, and at worst, more opinions. A strong opinion glosses over the nuances. Unless you've spent a substantive amount of time working with the subject, the opinion you 'hold' is most likely unfounded.

Many think of weak opinions as an 'unresearched' opinion, that is formed when the person has no real experience with it. "I think React is better than Vue because [points they've read from a blog]". In fact, we shouldn't even call it a weak opinion, because that's not even your own opinion - it's someone else's opinion; it's hearsay. And you should not even hold on to that.

Weak opinions comes from people who have a shallow understanding of the subject. You know when someone has a weak opinion when you scrutinize them and they are unable to give a specific answer backed with facts and case studies, but backs their opinions with more opinions.

Nuanced opinions are rooted in real-world experiences, mistakes, and facts. People with nuanced opinions would be able to talk about specifics - what one does better than the other, how they differ in style, etc. What is best _in this situation_.

"Objective opinions, strongly held; subjective opinions, weakly held; hearsay (unfounded strong opinions), not held."

But I get that this doesn't have the same ring to it, which does kind of makes my point - strong opinions are easy to hold, to remember, to communicate - it's definitive; nuanced opinions takes longer to communicate, but it's often better.
