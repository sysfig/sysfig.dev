Never be too keen to prove a point. Whether that's:

- proving your method is better, or someone else's method is flawed
- proving your understanding is correct, or someone else's is incorrect

It's a lose-lose situation for you.

You'd lose if you're right, because other people will see you as a know-it-all, who's there to catch their mistakes or shortcomings. The team would be less likely to be open about their mistakes or alternate way of thinking, fearful that you'll aggressively tear it apart.

You'd lose if you're wrong, because you'd be seen as someone who is often confidently incorrect, making what you say carry less weight and trustworthiness.

Instead, approach every conversation and debate as a journey of discovery. If you think something is done incorrectly, propose a hypothesis of why you think it's incorrect, and together test out that hypothesis. No one is right, no one is wrong, it's just someone having an idea and the whole team discovering the 'right' answer together. This builds cohesion and trust. Next time someone else thinks something is wrong, he/she/they would feel more comfortable speaking out.
