I have worked at several startups that had very few processes.

When they were a small team, communication was instant, decisions were instant, changes were rapid, consequences of failure were small, and long-term consequences are far away.

When they release a feature, they just send an email to their customers informing them of the new feature.

However, as the number of customers grow, the consequences of failure increases. As the team grows, the amount of communication and miscommunication increases.

When we release a feature now, it would have been preceeded by estimation, because the marketing team needs to create hype for the feature release, the sales team needs to make sales on the unreleased features, the customer success team needs to be trained on how to use and support the feature, the developer relations team need to prepare documentation and schedule Meetups and talks to promote the feature.

When the organization is at that size, it can no longer be so unstructured, otherwise the distribution of information will be very uneven, and miscommunication and errors will make the organization very inefficient. For a company at that scale, processes, conventions, and standards are very important to keep the organization progressing smoothly and efficiently.

So it should be obvious that to get from a 4-person startup to a 200-person startup, a lot of processes needs to be introduced, however, I've found that many small startups are reluctant to processes, for good reasons. "What we've been doing has been working so far, why introduce processes that's going to slow us down!"

And they are right! If the benefits of a process is outweighed by the beuracratic cost of implementing the process, then the process is indeed unnecessary.

However, often the benefits of processes are underestimated, leading to processes being implemented later than the optimal time. Yes, processes should make things more efficient,  but what are some of the benefits of processes that often get overlooked?

- Processes can depersonalize awkward situations

  For example, without processes, when the customer success or support team needs help on an issue, they may contact individual developers to ask for help, disrupting their work and forcing them to mental switch. One way to improve this would be to implement a rota, where one developer is the point of contact for other teams for that week, and will field all questions.

  Now, if a CS/support team asks a developer directly, it's no longer rude or dismissive to ask them to create a ticket; rather, it's just both agreeing to abide by the agreed process. The response of the dev to say no is no longer personal.

- formally-documented processes sets a common expectation between different teams and workers.

- Processes builds on top of other processes

  It's like before the invention of writing systems, information could only be passed verbally through speech. Information can get distorted and misinterpreted and human progress was slow. Since the invention of writing, human progress has ballooned. This is because information from one generation can now be passed to the next generation, and the previous generation no longer need to go through what the previous generation went through to obtain that knowledge. This 'free'ed them to go and discover and invent new tools and ideas.

  Similarly, having processes saves your team from solving the same problems over and over again. The process is a solution to the problems, and once documented, you no longer have to go through the same discussion and debates to arrive at that solution again. The process may not be perfect, it can act as the foundation for a better process. But the foundation is there now, we can focus on building the house.

  >  Without documented processes, solutions would have to continually be communicated.
