End-to-End (E2E) tests are the most important tests for a piece of software because they are the technical implementation of the contract between the software creator and its users. If all your E2E tests pass, then the contract is fulfilled.

Linus Torvalds, the creator and maintainer of Linux, one of the biggest open-source projects, famously said "[WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE!](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75)". He values not breaking the contract between the kernel and user-space programs above all else.

Code quality may not be high, unit test coverage may be low, performance may be dismal, but as long as you fulfill the contract, your software is _working_ and not _broken_, and that's the most important.

**N.B.** I am not suggesting E2E tests are the _only_ tests you need (that'd be a pretty low bar), but it is the most important.
