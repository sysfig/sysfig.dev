How do you know your team members are doing the work?

One all-too-common method is to micromanage.

A better method is to agree together on expectations (what I expect you to achieve in the next 2 weeks, e.g.) and holding them accountable to that. If expectations were exceeded, celebrate (but don't stretch the expectations more because then the developers may always under-estimate next time). If expectations are met, that's good. If expectations were not met, then figure out why (what's the obstable? And either readjust expectations for the next estimate, or fix the obstacle that's reducing that developer's productivity)

Once you've set expectations, you can leave them to do their work, and you focus on contributing your part as well, without having to micromanage.
