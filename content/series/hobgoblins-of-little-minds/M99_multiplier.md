The higher up the management ladder you go, the *less direct* of an impact that your work has on the business. When you are an Engineering Manager, you'll almost never write any code; yet the code is what implements the features that customers pay money to your company for. In contrast, the individual contributors have the most direct impact on the business.

Although less direct, the *amount* of impact you have on the business can (and should) be much larger than any single individual contributor. This is because any processes, policies, and culture that you impact will affect all the people you manage and their subordinates, and so on. Thus, the impact of your work is amplified by the size of the team you manage, *in addition to* your individual influence on the company.

So as you climb higher and higher up the management ladder, shift your focus from the miniscule details (e.g. which linting rule to enforce), progressively through higher and higher level changes:

- that the engineering team should enforce a set of linting rules
- that the engineering team should have standards for their code
- that the engineering team should have a process to enforce new standards and improve existing standards
