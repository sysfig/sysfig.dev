If you hire well, people will feel ownership of their work and would want to produce work.

The task of leadership, then, is to provide meaningful work, so that the people are motivated. Meaningful work typically involves working towards something meaningful - the organization must have a vision that is inspiring - something that makes a difference.

If the company itself does not do meaningful/inspiring work, then, at the very least, have some clear company-wide objectives which teams can base their team objectives towards. For example, the company-wide objective for the quarter may be to "Increase monthly revenue to 300k"; then, the tech team's quarterly objective may be to "Implement features that enable 100 outbound demos" (with the assumption that more demos means more sales and thus revenue).

If the team has a goal, a sort of gamification effect happens where they will become laser focused on reaching that goal.

It also helps that the team-level goals are discovered by the team themselves, and not be thrusted upon them, otherwise they may lose their sense of ownership, and thus loses commitment.

The bottomline is that people need to know that the company is moving in the right direction, and that they are making a real impact in how fast the company is moving.
