Abstraction - hiding a more complicated logic behind some simpler interface. In programming, abstraction is typically done using functions. When you use a function like `rand()`, you don't need to understand _how_ the function works, you only need to what to pass in, and what it'll give back. The logic is hidden from you. If the logic changes, those changes are also hidden from you.
