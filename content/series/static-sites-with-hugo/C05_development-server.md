It's not possible to serve our site by running a web server (like NGINX or Apache HTTP server) with `public/` as the site root. However, running a web server in the background and re-running `hugo` on every change can tiresome.

Hugo provides a fast development server that will watch for changes in your code, automatically rebuild the site, store the result in memory, and server it at the local host address (defaults to port `1313`). It also has a hot-reload feature, where it will inject some code into web page that'll allow the page to update itself without refreshing whenever the code changes. Generally, when developing a Hugo site, you should use this development server.

Start the development server by running `hugo server`.

```
hugo server
```

```

Although it's not a very useful home page, this 'Hello World' exercise has taught you how Hugo works and how content and layouts come together to form the page.
