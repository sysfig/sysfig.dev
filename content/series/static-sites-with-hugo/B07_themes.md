Instead of creating all your layouts, CSS files, icon sets, archetypes, etc. from scratch, you can download _themes_ from [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/). You can also create your own theme.

In general, it's a good practice to put the site/business-specific elements (e.g. logo) in the site's `layouts/` and `static/` directories, whilst all the more generic elements in a theme, even if you don't intend to publish it.

If you do decide to base our site on a third-party theme, you can override or extend a file in a theme by adding the same file to the `archetypes`, `data/`, `layouts/`, and `static/` directories.
