1. Move the king two places towards the rook
2. Move the rook towards and past the king and lands adjacent to the king

1. Cannot castle if you've moved your king or the rook you want to castle with
2. Cannot castle if your king is in check (i.e. cannot castle out of check)
3. Cannot castle through any positions where the king would be in check (i.e. cannot castle through check). Note that it's fine if the Rook moves through 'check'.
