# Phases of the Game

A chess game is usually broken into 3 phases - [opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_opening), [middlegame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_middlegame), and [endgame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame). Each phase requires a different set of skills to master.

## Opening

The opening is the phase where players develop their pieces into good positions (e.g. controlling the center). Since there are only a limited number of opening moves in the beginning (only 20 possible moves - 2 for each of the 8 pawns and 2 knights - for the very first move), many opening moves are studied extensively and most ranked players memorizes a small set of openings (called his/her _repertoire_) and uses these openings exclusively in their games.

Many openings are also given names so players can refer to the openings more easily; it's easier to say "He opened with the Queen's gambit" than to say "He played `- d4 d5 c4`".

The choice of openings to use largely depends on the player's and opponent's personality (whether he likes to play more aggressive or passive), and the skills of both players for executing and defending certain openings (if you know your opponent is great at Sicilian defense (`e4 c5`), then perhaps you won't play `e4` as your opening move).

Nowadays, with millions of chess games played online every day, and records of over-the-board (OTB) tournaments available online, there are now databases of chess games which can be analyzed (e.g. [Lichess open database](https://database.lichess.org)). From those analysis you can derive statistics on the win/draw/lose rates of certain openings.

## Middlegame

There are no memorization, no endgame tactics. The middlegame is what Magnus Carlsen called "pure chess"

## Endgame

The endgame is when most of the pieces are off the board. Typically, the endgame is where the king would be involved, if necessary.

Endgame, much like openings, there are a set of rules which you can follow to achieve mate or force a draw.

For example, if you have a bishop, a knight, and a king, it's possible to force a mate on a lone king. However, you have to follow some precise set of moves to get to the mate. This has been studied and proven to work but if you don't know the rules, then the opponent can get away with a draw. This is what happened to Russian grandmaster Vladimir Epishin (against Robert Kempinski in Germanyon 7th January 2001) and former Women's World Chess Champion Anna Ushenina (against Olga Girya in the Women Grand Prix in Geneva on 6th May 2013).

It's also been proven that it is impossible to mate with just a knight and king against a lone king; the match would end in a draw. Even with 2 knights and a king against a lone king, you cannot _force_ a mate (the opponent must blunder their defense). Knowing this, you know when to gracefully resign rather than drag the game on for no purpose.



## Why Split Up Into Phases?

The boundary between opening, middlegame, and endgame is not an exact one, and noticing the distinction is irrelevant during a game (after all, it's all just one move after another). So it's not useful to try to elucidate the exact turn when a game turns from opening to middlegame. What separating a game into phases is useful for is identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a player (be it yourself or your opponent). You can identify the phase of the game where you are weakest and do more practice and studies on it. Similarly, if you know your opponent has a strong endgame, you may opt to drag out the middlegame for longer and not trade pieces so readily.
