If you're ahead on material, trade (2 rook v 1 rook is harder than 1 rook vs no rook).
If you're behind in space, trade to create more space.
If you can trade your undeveloped piece with a developed piece, trade to 'regain' tempo.

In an open game (not the Open Game opening), give slightly more value to the Bishop than the Knight.
In a close game, give the Knight slightly more value than a Bishop.
