There are hundreds of popular openings, but there are some basic principles that underlie most of them.

1. Develop the pieces - at the beginning of the game, all your pieces are 'stuck' behind the rank of pawns. Apart from the pawns and knight, all of the other pieces cannot move. So one of the aims of the opening is to push _some_ pawns forward and allow the pieces on the home ranks to move out and away from home ranks. Afterall, the enemy's king is on the opposite side of the board, your pieces needs to leave the home ranks in order to attack the king.
2. Create a presence in the center of the board (the squares d4, d5, e4, e5)
3. Develop the less valuable pieces first - develop in the order pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, and then queen. Don't push the out to the frontier. The less valuable pieces are also the easiest to get out of the home ranks.
4. Aim to castle early - castling pushes your king into a safe 'castle' behind the rank of pawns, and also develops your rook towards the center
5. Connect the rooks
6. Move the king to a safe position, typically in the corner behind a rank of pawns (castle helps with this)

Although some openings are statistically better than others, you may wish to play a more unorthodox or statistically worse opening to catch your opponent off-guard. You may consider this when you know your opponent's opening theory is much stronger than yours. An example of this is [The Incorrect Opening](https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1068157) game between Anatoly Karpov and Anthony Miles. Miles, a grandmaster, understands that Karpov's Opening theory is much stronger than his, and so plays the [St. George Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Defence)

- _a3_ (A00 | Anderssen's Opening) - terrible opening move as the edge pawns controls only 1 square and not even a central square. It further hampers development as it only opens up the a1-rook to move to a2.

- **e4** (B00 | [King's Pawn Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Pawn_Game)) - Moves the pawn towards the center of the board. Opens up for the queen and king's bishop to develop. Prepares for an early king's side castle. But the e4 pawn is undefended, and it also makes the d4 and f4 squares weaker, as the e4 pawn is no longer available to defend it.
  - _a5_ (Corn Stalk Defence)
  - _a6_ (B00 | [St. George Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Defence) / Baker's Defence / Birmingham Defence / Basman Counterattack)
  - **c5** (B20 | [Sicilian Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence)) - After e4, white would ideally like to play d4. Black, by playing c5, prevents that. If white does play d4 (perhaps after defending it with Nf3), then black can trade the c5 pawn (a non-central pawn) with white's d4 pawn (central pawn)
    - b4 ([Wing Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Gambit)) - sacrifices the b-pawn to regain control of the d4 square

    - d4 ([Smith-Morra Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Smith%E2%80%93Morra_Gambit))
      - ...cxd4 - accepts the gambit
        - _c3_ - attacks the hanging d4-pawn, but black can easily defend it as part of its development with either e5 or Nc6
          - ..._dxc3_
            - **Nxc3** - reclaims the material whilst developing the knight and defending the e4-pawn
        - Nf3 - attacks the hanging d4-pawn whilst developing the knight
          - ...e6 - defends the d4-pawn whilst developing the e-pawn, opens the diagonals for the Queen and King's Bishop. The e5-pawn is hanging but if white plays Nxe5, black's Queen can execute a fork to Qa5, checking the king and the next move can capture the knight.
            - _Nxe5_
              - **Qa5+** - forks white's King and e5-Knight. This will result in white having a 2-pawn advantage, but down a knight.
        - _Qxd4_ - Immediately reclaim the material but develops the Queen too early and leave it vulnerable to attack, to which the Queen must retreat and lose tempo.
          - _Nc3_ - attacks the Queen, forcing it to retreat and lose tempo.
            - Qd3
      - ..._e6_ (A43 | Queen's Pawn Game, Franco-Sicilian Defense) - declines the gambit and defend with the f8-bishop. However, this will block one of the diagonal for the Queen's Bishop
        - d5 - white advances the d-pawn to attack the e6-pawn.
          - ...e5 - black declines to trade but has lost tempo because it took black 2 moves to move the e-pawn to e5
    - Nc3 (Sicilian, Closed)
    - Nf3 (Sicilian, Open)

    - Bc4 ([Bishop's Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s_Opening))
    - c3 ([Lopez Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lopez_Opening) / MacLeod Attack)
    - d4 - forces black's e5-pawn to take d4, maintaining white's e4-pawn's control in the center. This also opens up the Queen's file and Queen's c1-bishop's diagonal, making it easier to do a queenside castle. However, this also opens up the King to attack from both diagonals.
      - exd4 ([Center Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Game))
        - Qxd4 - reclaims material
          - Nc6 (C22) - attacks white's Queen and forces it off the center. If the white Queen retreats, white loses tempo.

      - Nc6 - defends the e5-pawn
        - Bb5 ([Ruy Lopez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruy_Lopez) / Spanish Opening / Spanish Game) - attacks the c6 knight that is defending the e5 pawn, thus indirectly putting more pressure on the e5 pawn.
          - a6 (Morphy Defence) - indirectly defends the e5-pawn by attacking the b5 bishop that's attacking the c6 knight. Forces the bishop to either attack the c6 knight or retreat.
            - a4 - white's bishop retreats
            - Bxc6 - Bishop trades itself with black's knight, leaving the e5-pawn undefended
              - dxc6 - Queen's pawn takes the bishop to get back material. More importantly, this opens up the Queen's file to later on perform a double attack on the e4-pawn should white takes the e5-pawn with the f3 knight.
                - Nxe5 - Takes the undefended e5-pawn
                  - Qd4 - performs a double-attack on the e5-knight and e4-pawn. The e5-knight typically moves away and black's Queen reclaim the material lost.

          - Nf6 (Berlin Defence)
        - Bc4 ([Italian Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Game)) - Allows your king to castle king's side. Places the bishop in the square with the most scope/reach. Bishop attacks the d5 square as well as the vulnerable f7-pawn.
          - ...Bc5 ([Giuoco Piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuoco_Piano)) - Places the bishop in the square with the most scope/reach. Bishop attacks the d4 square as well as the vulnerable f2-pawn.

          - _Nd4_ ([Blackburne Shilling Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburne_Shilling_Gambit) / Kostić Gambit) - 
            - 0-0
            - c3 - attacks the d4-knight
            - Nxd4 - attacks the d4-knight and prevents it from taking white's f3-knight, after which either the queen must expose itself to recapture material (and possibly retreating after, losing tempo), or the g2-pawn must do gxf3 which will mean the King's file will be open should white choose to castle Kingside.
            - Nxe5
          - Nf6 ([Two Knights Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Knights_Defense) / Fried Liver) - develops the remaining knight and attacks the e4-pawn
            - Ng5 - defends the e4-pawn and attacks the f7-pawn alongside the c4-bishop, which, with the knight, would lead to a fork for the d8-queen and h8-rook, or with the bishop for a mate and forces black's King to move e8-e7, preventing it from castling in the future. However, this can be defended by d5.
              - d5 - blocks the c4-bishop and g5-knight from ganging up on the f7-pawn.
                - **exd5** - takes black's pawn

    - Qf3 (C20 | [Napolean Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Opening)) - white is hoping for the [Scholar's Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar%27s_mate), where black's f7 pawn is not moved whilst white plays 2.Bc4 3.Qf7.
    - Qh5 (C20 | [Danvers Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danvers_Opening) / Kentucky Opening / Queen's Attack / Queen's Excursion / Wayward Queen Attack / Patzer Opening / Parham Attack) - white is hoping for the [Scholar's Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar%27s_mate), where black's f7 pawn is not moved whilst white plays 2.Bc4 3.Qf7.
  - e6 ([French Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence)) - black's plan is to move d5 next, attacking white's e4 pawn, whilst being defended by the queen and the e6 pawn. However, white can avoid this trade by moving e4 to e5. However, this defense impedes on the c8 bishop's diagonal and can hamper its development.
    - d4 - white establishes the pawn centre
      - d5 - challenges white's e4 pawn
        - e5 - advances the pawn to establish more space for white and avoid a trade
        - exd5
        - Nc3 - defends the e4 pawn

  - f6 (Alekhine's Defence)
  - _g5_ (Borg Defence | Basman Defence) - weakens King's side Defence
