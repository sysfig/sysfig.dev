There are hundreds of popular openings, but there are some basic principles that underlie most of them.

1. Develop the pieces - at the beginning of the game, all your pieces are 'stuck' behind the rank of pawns. Apart from the pawns and knight, all of the other pieces cannot move. So one of the aims of the opening is to push _some_ pawns forward and allow the pieces on the home ranks to move out and away from home ranks. Afterall, the enemy's king is on the opposite side of the board, your pieces needs to leave the home ranks in order to attack the king.
2. Create a presence in the center of the board (the squares d4, d5, e4, e5)
3. Develop the less valuable pieces first - develop in the order pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, and then queen. Don't push the out to the frontier. The less valuable pieces are also the easiest to get out of the home ranks.
4. Aim to castle early - castling pushes your king into a safe 'castle' behind the rank of pawns, and also develops your rook towards the center
5. Connect the rooks
6. Move the king to a safe position, typically in the corner behind a rank of pawns (castle helps with this)

Although some openings are statistically better than others, you may wish to play a more unorthodox or statistically worse opening to catch your opponent off-guard. You may consider this when you know your opponent's opening theory is much stronger than yours. An example of this is [The Incorrect Opening](https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1068157) game between Anatoly Karpov and Anthony Miles. Miles, a grandmaster, understands that Karpov's Opening theory is much stronger than his, and so plays the [St. George Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Defence)

- _a3_ (A00 | Anderssen's Opening) - terrible opening move as the edge pawns controls only 1 square and not even a central square. It further hampers development as it only opens up the a1-rook to move to a2.
  - h3
    - c4 (The Creepy Crawly)
- _a4_ (Ware Opening | Meadow Hay Opening)
- b3 ([Larsen's Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larsen%27s_Opening))
- c4 (English Opening) - Gains control of the central d5-square with a wing pawn. Opens the Queen's Queenside diagonal. Allows the b1-Knight to advance to c3 to put further pressure on the d5-square, without blocking the c-pawn.
  - ...e5 - Black stakes control over the f4 and d4 central square.
    - Nc3 - Develops the b1-Knight, puts pressure on the d5-square, assert itself over the e4 central square.
      - ...Nc6 - Similar to White, Black develops the b8-Knight, puts further pressure on the d4-sqaure, and defends the previously-haning e5-pawn.
        - g3 - Moves the pawn to fianchetto his f1-Bishop in the next move, aiming to put even more pressure on the central d5 and e4 squares, and along the h1-a8 diagonal in general.
          - ...Nf6 - Black develops the g8-Knight, and relieves some pressure from the d5 and e4 squares.
            - Bg2 - fianchetto the f1-bishop to gain control of the h1-a8 diagonal and d5 and e4 in particular.
              - ...Bb4 - Moves his f8-Bishop out of the way in preparation for a Kingside castle, and threatening a trade for White's c3-Knight, which, after White's pawn recaptures material, will lead to doubled pawns on the c-file
                - Nd5
                - Nf3
- d4 - Gives the Queen more influence, opens the Queenside bishop's diagonal, gains control of the c5 and central e5 square.
  - ...c5 (Old Benoni / Blackburne Defense) - tempts White into trading a central d-pawn with a wing c-pawn
    - d5 - Rejects the trade and gain space
    - dxc5 - White accepts the trade
  - ...d5 ([Closed Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_Game))
    - c4 ([Queen's Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit)) - attacks the central d5-pawn with an off-center c-pawn.
      - ...c6 ([Slav Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slav_Defense)) - guards the d5-pawn
        - Nc3 - continues attack of the d5-pawn
      - ...dxc4
        - Qa4+
          - ...Bd7
            - Qxc4
          - ...Nd7
            - Qxc4
          - ...Qd7
            - Qxc4
      - ...e6 - guards the d5-pawn
        - Nc3 - continues attack of the d5-pawn
          - ...Nf6 - defends the d5-pawn
            - Bg5 - pins the f6-Knight meaning it cannot defend the d5-pawn
              - **...Be7** - breaks the pin on the Queen and the f6-knight is able to defend the d5-pawn again. Also clears the way for the king to castle kingside.
              - ...h6 - attacks the g5-Bishop
                - Bh4 - retreats to a safe square. Black can continue the attack with g5, but that would break black's Kingside defensive pawn structure, risking black's king's safety should the king castle kingside.
            - cxd5 - trades an off-center c-pawn with black's center d5-pawn
      - _...Nf6_ - guards the d5-pawn, but is inferior to 2...e6 or 2...c6 because after 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.e4, white would have 2 center pawns and black's knight would be forced to retreat, losing tempo.
  - ...e6
  - ...f5 ([Dutch Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Defence)) - Similar to the English Opening (1.c4), Black is looking to get his g8-Knight to go to f6, behind the f5-pawn, with both of them exerting pressure on the e4-square. But it does open up the h5-e8 diagonal, exposing the King. It also 
    - Bg5 - Pins Black's e-pawn against the Queen, preventing it from advancing, and thus preventing the f8-Bishop from leaving its home rank via the a3-f8-diagonal. Also tempts Black to push the g5-Bishop back with the Kingside defensive pawns, breaking apart the pawn structure.
      - g6 - Since Black's e7-pawn is pinned, and Black wants to castle, Black moves the g-pawn 1 square to set up a fianchettoed Bishop and castle behind. Although this demolishes the defensive Kingside pawn structure.
    - e4 ([Staunton Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton_Gambit)) - sacrifices the e4-pawn for quick development
      - ...d6 ([Balogh Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balogh_Defense)) - Decline the gambit and defends the f5-pawn with the c8-bishop
      - ..._f4_ - Decline the gambit - but now white has two central pawns whereas black as a hanging f4-pawn
      - ...fxe4
        - Nc3
          - ...Nf6
  - ...Nf6 ([Indian Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Defence) | Indian Game) - Controlling e4 and d5 squares (prevents White's e-pawn from advancing 2 sqaures, prevents White's d4-pawn from advancing)
    - c4
      - ...e5 ([Budapest Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Gambit) / Budapest Defence)
      - ...e6
        - Nc3
          - Bb4 ([Nimzo-Indian Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzo-Indian_Defence))
        - Nf3
          - b6 (Queen's Indian)
      - ...g6
        - Nc3
          - d5 ([Gr√ºnfeld Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence))
- **e4** (B00 | [King's Pawn Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Pawn_Game)) - Moves the pawn towards the center of the board. Opens up for the queen and king's bishop to develop. Prepares for an early king's side castle. But the e4 pawn is undefended, and it also makes the d4 and f4 squares weaker, as the e4 pawn is no longer available to defend it.
  - _...a5_ (Corn Stalk Defence)
  - _...a6_ (B00 | [St. George Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Defence) / Baker's Defence / Birmingham Defence / Basman Counterattack)
  - **...c5** (B20 | [Sicilian Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence)) - After e4, white would ideally like to play d4. Black, by playing c5, prevents that. If white does play d4 (perhaps after defending it with Nf3), then black can trade the c5 pawn (a non-central wing pawn) with white's d4 pawn (central pawn)
    - b4 ([Wing Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Gambit)) - sacrifices the b-pawn to regain control of the d4 square
      - ...cxb4
        - d4
    - d4 ([Smith-Morra Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Smith%E2%80%93Morra_Gambit))
      - ...cxd4 - accepts the gambit
        - _c3_ - attacks the hanging d4-pawn, but black can easily defend it as part of its development with either e5 or Nc6
          - ..._dxc3_
            - **Nxc3** - reclaims the material whilst developing the knight and defending the e4-pawn
        - Nf3 - attacks the hanging d4-pawn whilst developing the knight
          - _...e5_ - defends the d4-pawn whilst developing the e-pawn, opens the diagonals for the Queen and King's Bishop. The e5-pawn is hanging but if white plays Nxe5, black's Queen can execute a fork to Qa5, checking the king and the next move can capture the knight. But this move also means the d5 central square no longer has any pawns that can control it.
            - **c3** - forces a trade of white's wing c-pawn with black's central d4-pawn. Opens up the queenside diagonal for the Queen.
              - ...dxc3
                - Nxc3 - recaptures material whilst developing the b1-Knight. White now has the e4-pawn and c3-knight both controlling the central d5-square, which Black has no pawns to defend.
                  - ...Nc6 - defends the e5-pawn whilst developing the b8-Knight
                    - Bc4 - Puts further pressure on the d5-square, as well as threaten the f7-pawn (which is only defended by the King)
            - _Nxe5_
              - **Qa5+** - forks white's King and e5-Knight. This will result in white having a 2-pawn advantage, but down a knight.
        - _Qxd4_ - Immediately reclaim the material but develops the Queen too early and leave it vulnerable to attack, to which the Queen must retreat and lose tempo.
          - _Nc6_ - attacks the Queen, forcing it to retreat and lose tempo.
            - Qd3
      - ..._e6_ (A43 | Queen's Pawn Game, Franco-Sicilian Defense) - declines the gambit and defend with the f8-bishop. However, this will block one of the diagonal for the Queen's Bishop
        - d5 - white advances the d-pawn to attack the e6-pawn.
          - ...e5 - black declines to trade but has lost tempo because it took black 2 moves to move the e-pawn to e5
    - Nc3 (Sicilian, Closed)
    - Nf3 (Sicilian, Open)
      - ...d6
        - d4
          - ...cxd4
            - Nxd4
              - ...Nf6
                - Nc3
                  - ...g6 (Sicilian, Dragon Variation)
      - ...Nc6
        - d4
          - ...cxd4
            - Nxd4
              - ...g6 (Sicilian Accelerated Dragon)
              - ...Nf6
                - Nc3
                  - ...e5 (Sveshnikov)
  - ...c6 ([Caro‚ÄìKann Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caro%E2%80%93Kann_Defence))
  - ...d5 (B01 | [Scandinavian Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Defence) / Center Counter Defence / Center Counter Game)
    - exd5
      - ...Qxd5
        - Nc3
          - ...Qa5
  - e5 ([Open Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game)) - counter-attacks the center
    - Bb5 ([Portuguese Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Opening))
    - Bc4 ([Bishop's Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s_Opening))
    - c3 (C20 | [Lopez Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lopez_Opening) / Centre Pawn Opening / MacLeod Attack) - prepares white's d-pawn to push to d4, which would establish a strong center. However, this blocks the knight from moving to c3
      - **...d5** - attacks white's undefended e5-pawn, black's d5-pawn is defended by the Queen
        - d3 - defends the e5-pawn, but the d3-pawn now blocks the F-bishop
          - **...Nf6** - develops the knight. Applies more pressure on the e5-pawn. Black now have two pieces attacking it, whilst it's only being defended by one white pawn. If white moves exd5, the knight can be used to retake white's pawn instead of moving the Queen. However, this moves blocks black's f-pawn from progressing, which may not be an issue if black plans to do king-side castle
            - **Nf3** - attack black's undefended e5-pawn
              - **...dxe4**
                - **Ne5**
                - _dxe4_ - opens the d-file for black's Queen to capture white's Queen, forcing white's King to move to d1 next move, hence forfeiting the ability to castle. The e4-pawn is also undefended, meaning black can capture it with its f6-knight.
                  - **Qxd1+** - forces a trade of the Queens, forcing white's King to move, forfeiting its ability to castle
                    - Kxd1 - no other possible moves
        - **exd5** - trades white's undefended e5-pawn with black's d5-pawn
          - **...Qxd5** - recaptures the pawn material
            - **d4** - baits black to go exd4, which would allow white to cxd4, essentially trading a non-central pawn with a central pawn
      - ...Nf6 - attacks white's undefended e-4 pawn
        - Nf3
    - d4 - forces black's e5-pawn to take d4, maintaining white's e4-pawn's control in the center. This also opens up the Queen's file and Queen's c1-bishop's diagonal, making it easier to do a queenside castle. However, this also opens up the King to attack from both diagonals.
      - exd4 ([Center Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Game))
        - Qxd4 - reclaims material
          - Nc6 (C22) - attacks white's Queen and forces it off the center. If the white Queen retreats, white loses tempo.
            - Qe3 (Paulsen's Attack)
      - c3 ([Danish Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Gambit))
    - _f4_ ([King's Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Gambit)) - Sacrifices the f4-pawn so that Black's e5-pawn is no longer in the center. If Black accepts this gambit, then White will look to eventually play d4, leading to 2 pawns taking control of the center. Black's f4-pawn would then also be undefended. However, the King's Gambit weakens the defensive Kingside pawn structure, since if White castles Kingside, then the castled King at g8 would be open to the g8-a7 diagonal. Moving the f2-pawn also opens the King to attack on the e1-h4 diagonal.
      - **...exf4** (King's Gambit Accepted) - although the pawn is hanging, Black now does control the e3 and g3 squares. Black threatens Qh4+, which forces White's King to move e1-e2, removing White's ability to castle.
        - Ng3 - removes the Qh4+ threat whilst developing the Knight
          - ...d6
            - d4 - puts a second pawn in the center square and threats to recapture material with Bxf4
              - ...g5 - defends the hanging f4-pawn
      - d5 (Falkbeer Countergambit)
      - Bc5 (Classical Defence)
    - _Ke2_ ([Bongcloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongcloud_Attack)) - possibly the worst move you can make as it moves the King (meaning it cannot castle), exposes the King to attack, blocks one of the Queen and Kingside bishop's diagonal.
    - Nc3 ([Vienna Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Game))
    - Nf3 ([King's Knight Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Knight_Opening)) - attacks Black's e5-pawn, claims control of the d4-square, and develops the g1-Knight
      - d6 ([Philidor Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philidor_Defence))
        - Nc3
          - g6
            - Bc4
              - Bg4
                - Nxe5
                  - Bxd1
                    - Bxf7+
                      - Ke7
                        - Nd5# (Legall's Mate)
      - Nc6 - defends the e5-pawn, counters f3-Knight's claim to the d4-square, and develops the b8-Knight
        - Bb5 ([Ruy Lopez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruy_Lopez) / Spanish Opening / Spanish Game) - attacks the c6 knight that is defending the e5 pawn, thus indirectly putting more pressure on the e5 pawn.
          - ...a6 (Morphy Defence) - indirectly defends the e5-pawn by attacking the b5 bishop that's attacking the c6 knight. Forces the bishop to either attack the c6-Knight or retreat.
            - a4 - white's bishop retreats
            - Bxc6 - Bishop trades itself with black's knight, leaving the e5-pawn undefended
              - dxc6 - Queen's pawn takes the bishop to get back material. More importantly, this opens up the Queen's file to later on perform a double attack on the e4-pawn should white takes the e5-pawn with the f3 knight.
                - Nxe5 - Takes the undefended e5-pawn
                  - Qd4 - performs a double-attack on the e5-knight and e4-pawn. The e5-knight typically moves away and black's Queen reclaim the material lost.
          - ...Nge7 (Cozio Defence)
          - ...g6 (Smyslov Defence)
          - ...Nd4 (Bird's Defence)
          - ...d6 (Steinitz Defence)
          - ...f5 (Schliemann Defence) - Similar to the King's Gambit, Black is looking to trade a wing f-pawn with White's central e4-pawn. And also like the King's Gambit, this weakens the King's defense as it's now open on the h5-e8 diagonal.
            - d3 - Defends the e4-pawn and opens the diagonal for the c1-Bishop.
            - d4
            - _exf5_ - White captures the undefended f5-pawn but allows Black's e5-pawn to advance
              - ...e5 - Attacks the f3-Knight, pressuring it to move
                - Qd2 - the Queen pins the e4-pawn to the King, absolutely preventing it from capturing the f3-Knight
                  - ...Qd7 - Counters White's last move and reignite the threat on the f3-Knight.
            - Nc3 - Develops the b1-Knight and protects the e4-pawn
          - ...Bc5 (Classical Defence)
          - ...Nf6 (Berlin Defence)
        - Bc4 ([Italian Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Game)) - Allows your king to castle king's side. Places the bishop in the square with the most scope/reach. Bishop attacks the d5 square as well as the vulnerable f7-pawn.
          - ...Bc5 ([Giuoco Piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuoco_Piano)) - Places the bishop in the square with the most scope/reach. Bishop attacks the d4 square as well as the vulnerable f2-pawn. Note that Black now have the 3 men (c5-Bishop, c6-Knight, e5-pawn attacking d4, whilst White only has the f3-Knight)
            - b4 ([Evans Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_Gambit)) - sacrifices the b-pawn to deflect the c5-bishop
              - ...cxb4 - accepts the wing gambit, gaining material
                - c3 - attacks the b4-bishop
                  - ...
                    - d4 - gain control of the center
            - c3 - guards the d4-square, anticipating the next move to be d4. But it blocks the b1-Knight from advancing to its natural square, although the intention is that this hindrance is only temporary.
              - ...Nf6 - defends the d5-square and attacks the hanging central e4-pawn
                - d3
                - d4 - forces the e5-pawn to trade with the d4-pawn, and after ...exd4 cxd4, Black's c5-Bishop must move again and potentially lose tempo
                  - ...Bb4 - Checks the King. White must now block (and prepares the trade) one of b1-Knight, c1-Bishop, or f3-Knight to block the check. White wants to prevent the King from moving, otherwise it can't castle.
                    - Nb3
                    - Bd2
                      - ...Nxe4
            - Nc3 - defends the e4-pawn, controls b5 and the central d5-square. Similar to Black's claim on d4, White is now pressuring d5 with 3 attackers but Black has no defenders for d5.
              - ...Nf6 - Develops the g8-Knight, attacks the e4-pawn, assert control on the d5-square.
                - d3 - Defending the e4-pawn (now 2 defenders vs. 1 attacker), opens the diagonal for the c1-bishop.
                  - ...d6 - Defending the e5-pawn (now 2 defenders vs. 1 attacker), opens the diagonal for the c8-bishop.
                    - O-O - King safety
                      - ...O-O - King safety
          - Be7 ([Hungarian Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Defense))
          - d6 ([Semi-Italian Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Italian_Opening) / Half Giuoco Piano / Lesser Giuoco Piano / Paris Defence)
          - _Nd4_ ([Blackburne Shilling Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburne_Shilling_Gambit) / Kostiƒá Gambit) - 
            - 0-0
            - c3 - attacks the d4-knight
            - Nxd4 - attacks the d4-knight and prevents it from taking white's f3-knight, after which either the queen must expose itself to recapture material (and possibly retreating after, losing tempo), or the g2-pawn must do gxf3 which will mean the King's file will be open should white choose to castle Kingside.
            - Nxe5
          - Nf6 ([Two Knights Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Knights_Defense) / Fried Liver) - develops the remaining knight and attacks the e4-pawn
            - Ng5 - defends the e4-pawn and attacks the f7-pawn alongside the c4-bishop, which, with the knight, would lead to a fork for the d8-queen and h8-rook, or with the bishop for a mate and forces black's King to move e8-e7, preventing it from castling in the future. However, this can be defended by d5.
              - d5 - blocks the c4-bishop and g5-knight from ganging up on the f7-pawn.
                - **exd5** - takes black's pawn
        - d4 ([Scotch Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_Game) / Scotch Opening)
          - **...exd4** -

                - Nxd4
      - ...Nf6 (Petroff Defense) - Instead of defending the e5-pawn, Black looks to trade pawns with White by threatening White's e4-pawn.
        - Nxe5
          - ...d6 - Forces White's knight to retreat whilst developing the diagonal for the Queenside bishop. But this blocks the Kingside bishop's diagonal.
            - Nf3 - White's Knight retreats
              - ...Nxe4 - Black reclaims material
    - Qf3 (C20 | [Napolean Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Opening)) - white is hoping for the [Scholar's Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar%27s_mate), where black's f7 pawn is not moved whilst white plays 2.Bc4 3.Qf7.
    - Qh5 (C20 | [Danvers Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danvers_Opening) / Kentucky Opening / Queen's Attack / Queen's Excursion / Wayward Queen Attack / Patzer Opening / Parham Attack) - white is hoping for the [Scholar's Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar%27s_mate), where black's f7 pawn is not moved whilst white plays 2.Bc4 3.Qf7.
  - e6 ([French Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence)) - black's plan is to move d5 next, attacking white's e4 pawn, whilst being defended by the queen and the e6 pawn. However, white can avoid this trade by moving e4 to e5. However, this defense impedes on the c8 bishop's diagonal and can hamper its development.
    - d4 - white establishes the pawn centre
      - d5 - challenges white's e4 pawn
        - e5 - advances the pawn to establish more space for white and avoid a trade
        - exd5
        - Nc3 - defends the e4 pawn
        - Nd2 - defends the e4 pawn but blocks the diagonal for the c1 bishop as well as the Queen's file
  - _...f6_ (Barnes Defence | Alekhine's Defence) - Opens the King to attack on the h5-e8 diagonal, blocks the g8-Knight from moving to f6, and breaks the defensive Kingside pawn structure.
  - _g5_ (Borg Defence | Basman Defence) - weakens King's side defense
- _f3_ (Barnes Opening | Gedult's Opening) - a passive move that gives up white's first-move advantage. It opens up the king to the h4-e1 diagonal, prevents King's Knight from developing via the f3 square, weaken the Kingside pawn structure (after castling Kingside, those pawns can be used to shield the King), and if the King do castle Kingside, the absence of the f2-pawn opens the King to the g1-a7 diagonal. Often considered the worst opening move out of the 20 possible opening moves.

- f4 (A02 | [Bird's Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird%27s_Opening) / Dutch Attack) - gives white control of the e5 square, but exposes the king along the h4-e1 diagonal.
  - d5 (A03)
  - e5 (From's Gambit)
- _g4_ ([Grob's Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grob%27s_Attack))
- h3 ([Clemenz Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemenz_Opening))
- Nc3 ([Dunst Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunst_Opening)) - blocks the c-pawn and thus indirectly limits the c-pawn's potential to defend the d-pawn.
  - **...d5** - protected by the queen, the d5-pawn controls the center, taking away control of the e4 square away from the c3-knight.
    - ...e4 - looking to trade with the d5-pawn. After 2...dxe4 3.Nxe4, both sides have lost a pawn but white has gained tempo and white's knight controls the center whilst all black's pieces are unmoved.
    - _...Nf3_
      - c5 - takes control of the d4 square away from the f3-knight. Frees up the Queen's queenside diagonal. It also allows the b8-knight to move to c6 without blocking the c-pawn.
