- Shuffle Chess - the pieces on each player's the home ranks are randomized
- [Fischer Random chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess) - same as shuffle chess but with 2 additional constraints:
  - the bishops must be on different colored squares
  - there must be rooks on both sides of the king allowing it to castle on both sides

- Rapid / Blitz / Bullet - generally, the faster shorter the time controls, the more blunders and inaccuracies there will be. Playing Blitz and Bullet chess can help you get some practice in but is not good for learning chess, as you don't have enough time to think through your moves. Games with faster game controls relies on your pattern recognition and intuition - which you won't develop in the beginning.

  For reference, FIDE uses the time control 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game with an addition of 30 seconds per move starting from move one.

  For a beginner, you should avoid Blitz and Bullet, if you want a meaningful but quick game, consider playing a Rapid (15|10) (15 minutes with 10 seconds increment, meaning there's a 'reserve' time of 15 minutes and an additional 10 seconds for each move) game.
