- At the chess board is where you practice what you have learnt and solidify the theory with practice. If you are looking to learn about tactics and strategy, read books and studies - the chess board will not show you this. The chess board will put your understanding to the test. Read/study to improve, play chess to practice and apply what you've learnt. You need both.
- At the beginning of each move, make it a habit to check:
  - Can you check the opponent?
  - Are there any hanging pieces left by the opponent?
  - Are there any pieces we've left hanging?
  - Are there any mating threats?
- How good you are depends on how many patterns you recognize.
