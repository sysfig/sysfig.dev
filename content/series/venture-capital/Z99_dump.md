## What is Venture Capital? How does it differ from other types of funding?

_Venture capital_ (VC) is one type of _private equity_ (PE) funding available to _startups_. When accepting VC funding from a _VC firm_, the startup gives up a portion of the company (i.e. _equity_, say 25%) in exchange for a large sum of money (e.g. US$1,000,000).

Venture capital is for startups, not established companies. Startups, by definition, are non-established companies that uses innovation to drive rapid growth, and have the potential to grow substantially in a scalable way, given they get an injection of money. This is different from  small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) like a coffee shop or an online store because these don't rely on innovation in product, process, or business model.

But because startups are not well-established, they have yet to prove that their product and/or business model is viable and scalable. This means financing startups is risky - the startup may fail and investors may never see the returns they hoped for. For a startup to secure VC funding, they must convince investors that, should it succeed. the above-average returns is worth the risk.

VC is a type of private equity that funds high-risk startups. PE also:

- invest in established companies
- acquires struggling companies to 'turn things around' by installing new management, restructuring debt, etc.

## The VC Process

### Raising the VC Fund

VC firms don't invest in companies directly. VC firms create _VC funds_ (or _venture funds_) - a pool of money contributed by accredited outside investors - which actually fund the startups. The VC funds are managed by VC firms, but they are separate legal entities, typically formed as limited partnerships. In this context, the VC firm that manages the VC fund is called the fund's _general partner_ (GP). Small VC firms may manage one VC fund at a time, whilst larger VC firms may manage multiple funds concurrently.

When a VC firm starts a new fund, it will set a fundraising target (e.g. US$50 million) as well as the strategy for the fund - what industry (e.g. cryptocurrencies), geographical region (e.g. Asia), investment size (e.g. $125k micro-investments or 5 million investments), it will focus on, if any. After setting out its strategy, the VC fund will then solicit commitments of investment from:

- the GP itself - most GPs commit a small amount of their own funds into the VC fund
- institutional investors
- Sovereign funds
- private equity firms
- high net worth individuals (HNWIs)

For time-sensitive investments, the VC firm may begin investing in companies even before the fundraising target it reached. But once the fundraising target _is_ reached, the fund is _closed_ and the VC firm will transition from fundraising mode into 100% investing mode. Most GPs will aim to invest all of the funds within 5 years; any longer than that may make the investors unhappy, since the money they've committed is not put to use unless its invested.

### Investing

1. [Startup] Submits proposal, typically involves a business plan, ?$for&+%
2. [VC firm] Reviews the proposal
3. [VC firm] Do some background research on the startup
4. [VC firm] Accepts the proposal
3. [VC firm] Perform due diligence - an investigation into the startup's financials, key people/senior management, operating history, products, etc. to confirm that the investment is sound. For example, the startup founders may boast a high customer satisfaction rate, but due diligence may reveal that many of the positive reviews are fabricated. Another example may be to make sure that a growing startup does not carry a lot of technical debt, because that would hinder their future growth. The VC firm would most likely ask the startup to provide internal documentation as part of this process. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/due-diligence.asp
4. [VC firm] Complete due diligence and offers startup money in exchange for equity. Typically, the money is provided in rounds, giving investors opportunities to monitor progress and provide feedback before releasing subsequent rounds.

#### Classes of Equity

Typically, a startup that plan on accepting outside investment would create at least 2 classes of equity: _common equity_ and _preferred equity_. The common equity are kept by the founders and distributed to employees, whilst the preferred equity is what's offered to investors.

Whilst both types of equity represents ownership of the startup, preferred equity confers additional privileges and rights, such as:

https://venturebeat.com/2011/03/28/demystifying-the-vc-term-sheet-protective-provisions/

- seats on the board of directors
- voting rights
- dividend payments
- information rights - have access to specific internal company information, such as operating metrics, cash position, revenue, burn rate, runway, financial statements, current cap table, etc.
- veto rights - block certain actions (e.g. sale of company)
- pre-emptive rights - guarantees them the right to participate in future funding rounds to avoid their shares being diluted
- liquidation preference (LP) - a liquidation preference is a clause/provision that determines the order sales proceeds are paid out to each investor and debtholders when the company is sold (i.e. liquidated). In practice, the liquidation preference protects an investor's investment should the company be liquidated at a lower value than the investor originally anticipated. This can happen if the startup exits through a merger, or is selling off its assets due to bankruptcy. It ensures that the investor would get some or all of its money back before the rest of the proceeds from the sale are distributed to the other shareholders.

  When the company is liquidated, the proceeds are distributed to its shareholders (entities that have equity in the company), but this distribution is not done evenly if preferred equity with a liquidation preference is involved. In such cases, proceeds are first distributed to equity holders with a liquidation preference, only then are the rest distributed amongst all shareholders.
  
  There are many features that determines the terms for a liquidation preference. In the discussing these features, we will use the example of an investor that has invested US$1 million in a company and holds 10% preferred equity, for an initial valuation of US$10 million. And whilst there are no legal requirements for liquidation preference to be structured this way, most liquidation preference provisions specify the following:
  
  - multiple - the multiple determines the amount the investor must be paid back before the remaining of the proceeds are distributed to common shareholders. For example, if our investor holds a 2.0x liquidation preference and the company sold for US$6 million, then US$2 million (initial US$1 million investment multiplied by the 2.0x multiple) must be paid back to our investor before the rest (US$4 million) are distributed amongst the common shareholders.

  If the startup sold for only $1 million, and our investor is the only one holding equity with a liquidation preference, then our investor would get his US$1 million back whilst the common shareholders would receive nothing from the sale.

  Note that the multiple applies to the investment amount (e.g. the $US1 million) and the percentage equity ownership is irrelevant in its calculation.

  - participating vs non-participating - If the liquidation preference is _non-participating_ (a.k.a. _straight_), then when the company is liquidated, the investor can choose to exercise the liquidation preference and receive the guaranteed investment-times-multiple _or_ convert its preferred shares to common shares before the proceeds are distributed. This means if the company is sold for a higher value than when the investment was made, the investor reaps the benefits.

  For example, if our investor holds 2.0x a non-participating liquidation preference and the company sold for $100 million, then if our investor should _not_ exercise the liquidation preference since he/she/they will only get back US$2 million. Instead, our investor should convert the preferred shares (10%) to common shares, and get US$10 million (US$100 x 10%) instead.

  With non-participating liquidation preference, the investor gets a guarantee should the startup be sold cheaper than expected, but reaps the benefits if it becomes more valuable than when the investment was made.
  
  With participating liquidation preference, the investor will not only get his/her/their guaranteed investment-times-multiple, but will _also_ get a slice of the remaining proceeds based on its equity stake. For example, if our investor holds a 2.0x participating liquidation preference and the company sold for US$6 million, and given our investor was the only one holding preferred equity, it means he/she will receive an addition $400k (US$4 million multiplied by 10%) for a total of US$2.4 million return.
  
  Most liquidation preference are non-participating.

  - Cap - the cap applies only for participating liquidation preference and puts an upper limit on the amount an investor gets back should they choose _not_ to convert their preferred shares to common shares. For example, if our investor holds 1.0x participating 3x-cap liquidation preference and the company sold for US$50 million, then he/she/they would receive at most US$3 million (3x-cap multiplied by $1 million initial investment) unless he/she/they convert their preferred shares to common shares. If they convert, then they'll receive $5 million (10% * $50 million).

  A participating liquidation preference with no cap is usually referred to as _full participating_.

  - seniority - liquidation preference ensures investors with preferred shares are paid back before common shareholders. But if there are multiple investors with preferred shares, and the amount of sales proceeds is not enough to pay back all the preferred shareholders, then the seniority of the liquidation preference determines who gets the cash.

  Typically, the investors of later rounds get higher seniority. This means if the Series A investor invested $5m and the Series B investors invested $10 million, and the company sold for $12 million, the Series B investor would get $10m back, whilst the Series A investor would only get back $2m.

  In the less common _Pari Passu_ seniority structure, investor in every round has the same seniority and sales proceeds are distributed _pro rata_ based on the investment amount (_not_ equity ownership).

  There's also a hybrid _tiered_ seniority structure, where investors from different rounds are grouped into tiers (e.g. Series A to C in lower tier, Series D to E in middle tier, and F to K in the highest tier). The standard seniority structure is used between each tier, and Pari Passu is used within each tier.

  

If you're an investor, you'd want to have a high-multiple, participating, no-cap liquidation preference


understand probabilities. If only 10% of the startups they fund succeed, but that 10% provides a 100 times return on investment, then the VC firm stands to make a 10x return.


- VC firms often have a large portfolio and can often connect you with the right network
- VC firms often offers advice/counsel



Typical VC investments _exits_ between 8 to 12 years, this is often called the fund's _lifespan_.

## Is Venture Capital right for me?

_when_ to raise money - only raise money when:
  1) you can't scale without it, or
  2) you need connections and advice from VCs.
  
  Often, you are able to find product-market fit _before_ you need to raise money, and you raise money to help your startup scale and reach more people through marketing and network connections. However, some ideas requires capital to achieve the scale it needs to work in the first place, so this does not apply to those ideas.
_why_ to raise money - what will you use the extra money for?
_who_ to take money from - what do they offer apart from money?
_what_ do I give up in exchange for the money?

- Investors get a slice of the company, and can affect future decisions the company makes (through board seats?)

There are other ways to fund your business


- other types of private equity:
  - leveraged buyouts
  - mezzanine financing
  - private placements
angel investors (angels) - high net worth individuals (HNWIs)
- Taking on debt
  - Bank loans
  - government small business loan
  - convertible promissory note (a.k.a. _convertible notes_) - a short-term debt that converts to equity (usually preferred equity) in the company that issued it when certain conditions outlined in the promissory note are met (e.g. Series A closes). Typically, it will convert with a discounted rate (20%) compared to what the other investors in the round is paying. Basically, with convertible notes, the lender gets paid back in discounted shares rather than with interest.
  
    Issuing a note costs around $2k in legal fees compared to $20k for issuing preferred stocks. And since it's a loan, the investors doesn't get given privileges and rights that comes with preferred stocks.

    If the conditions are not met, then the startup must repay the loan plus interest or the note is automatically converted into shares.

- Are the VC firm familiar with the industry? Have they funded other companies in the same industry in the past? Are they successful?

## Exit

merger, acquisition, or initial public offering (IPO). 

### IPO

Preferred shares are converted into common shares.

## Dump

## History of Venture Capital

"""
Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot is generally considered the "Father of Venture Capital". He started the American Research and Development Corporation (ARD) in 1946 and raised a $3.5 million fund to invest in companies that commercialized technologies developed during WWII."""(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp

Pitchbook
National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) - organization of VC firms

Small Business Investment Act (SBIC) in 1958 - tax breaks for investors
Amendments to the the Revenue Act reduce the capital gains tax, first in 1978 from 49.5% to 28%, then again in 1981 to 20%.
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was changed in 1979 to allowed pension funds to invest up to 10% of their total funds into VC funds.
