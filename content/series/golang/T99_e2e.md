As I wrote in [E2E Tests are the Most Important](/series/hobgoblins-of-little-minds/e2e-tests-most-important/)...end-to-end tests are the most important.

Cucumber (i.e. BDD-styled E2E tests) is great because it is both a form of technical specification and a test suite.

Cucumber provides an official framework called [Godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog). The current version is 0.10.0 and there's a disclaimer in the [`README.md`](https://github.com/cucumber/godog/blob/master/README.md) that "The API is likely to change a few times before we reach 1.0.0".

Godog does not interfere with `go test`. `go test` will only run test routines that has the form `func TestXxx(*testing.T)`. So we can write our Cucumber tests in `*_test.go` files without it affecting `go test`

When you run `godog`, it'll first compile the source code to produce a test executable.
