In the course of writing this post, I Googled "software is about people". Most of the posts that came up is about how you have to design software to be used by people, and not design or implement software in isolation of your customers. Whilst that is true, that's not the point of this post.

Instead, this post will focus on the design and development of software has a lot more to do with people than with coding.

## The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

One of the most cited software design principle is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). But SRP is often conflated with other principles like "Do One Thing and Do It Well" and the "separation of concerns".

In The Clean Code Blog's entry for [The Single Responsibility Principle](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html), it literally and explicitly states "This principle is about people."

## Conway's Laws

It brings to light the non-obvious fact that the design of a technical system does not begin with engineers and architects, but with the person or people who designed the _people_ organization.

## Conclusions

Coding is really just a formal implementation of ideas - ideas which originated with, and refined by, people. Implementing ideas with code is the easy part of software development; afterall, every programming language construct used in the implementation has been invented, and thus fully-understood, by humans. Coming up with good ideas and designs is the much harder part, for it involves working with people that think differently than you. But it is this human part of software development that is the most valuable.
