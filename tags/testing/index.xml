If all your E2E tests pass, then the contract is fulfilled.
Linus Torvalds, the creator and maintainer of Linux, one of the biggest open-source projects, famously said &amp;ldquo;WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE!&amp;rdquo; (an opinion which he consistently expresses). He values:
Not breaking the contract between the kernel and user-space programs Don&amp;rsquo;t make changes to the contact that&amp;rsquo;s incompatible with previous contracts Now, I&amp;rsquo;d bet the software you&amp;rsquo;re writing have fewer dependents than the Linux kernel, and you can change the contract more freely, but the purpose of this article is to drill home the point that you should not break contracts.</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Tests</title><link>https://sysfig.dev/series/golang/end-to-end-e2e-tests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 07:24:21 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://sysfig.dev/series/golang/end-to-end-e2e-tests/</guid><description>As I wrote in E2E Tests are the Most Important&amp;hellip;end-to-end tests are the most important.</description></item><item><title>Testing</title><link>https://sysfig.dev/series/golang/testing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:57 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://sysfig.dev/series/golang/testing/</guid><description>Go&amp;rsquo;s standard library contains a testing package, which provides support for automated testing of Go packages. You define test routines and use the built-in go test command to run them.
The go tool also provides commands for benchmarking and code coverage.</description></item><item><title>Testing Basics</title><link>https://sysfig.dev/series/golang/testing-basics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:57 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://sysfig.dev/series/golang/testing-basics/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have an exported function called Factorial in math.go
package math // Factorial - Get the factorial of a positive integer func Factorial(n int) uint64 { if n &amp;lt; 2 { return 1 } return uint64(n) * Factorial(n-1) } We can write a unit test for it in the same package (i.e. same directory) without importing it. The name of the file should end in _test.go (e.g. math_test.go). Any files named with the _test.</description></item></channel></rss>
